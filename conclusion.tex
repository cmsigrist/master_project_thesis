In this thesis, we presented a solution to port Java to native restrictions and streamline the computation of reachability metadata. 
Java under native restrictions provides a way to quickly test a metadata configuration by avoiding the overhead of building an image.
By introducing native restrictions checks and scopes in Java, we showed that it was possible to modify the semantics of the language to match Native Image's while keeping the set of changes to Java itself to a minimum.

Java under native restrictions enabled us to validate and drive Native Image's semantics for dynamic class loading and reflection. These semantics are implemented both in written specifications and in the form of a TCK. Moreover, he TCK offers a future-proof mean to assert that future versions of Native Image still behave according to the same semantics. 

Finally, to address the issues of reachability metadata collection with GraalVM's Tracing Agent, we implemented another Tracing Agent in Java. This agent is, in all essence, another language restrictions that records all reflectively-accessed elements instead of enforcing native restrictions checks. The advantage of this approach is that, unlike GraalVM's agent, the Java agent follows the same semantics as Native Image. Therefore, no element is missing from the reachability metadata as a result of the JVM taking a different path during an execution run. \todo{future work?}
