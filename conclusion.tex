\chapter{Conclusion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the conclusion, you repeat the main result and finalize the discussion of
your project. Mention the core results and why as well as how your system
advances the status quo.

You may optionally include a subsection on future work, but aim to end with a concluding sentence on why the current results may have set the stage for the future.
