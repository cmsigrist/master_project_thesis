LambdaForm: 
- The symbolic, non-executable form of a method handle's invocation semantics.
- Has a field MemberName vmentry;   // low-level behavior, or null if not yet prepared
- Kind DMH.invokeVirtual, linkToCallSite
- prepare() makes the LF executable -> every MH must prepare its LF
- prepare() -> generateLFInterpreterEntryPoint generate bytecode for the MemberName
- compile create bytecode for the LF and its MemberName
- loadMethod(): define the invoker class and resolve its MemberName

     * The main problem here is to keep LFs reasonably generic,
     * while ensuring that hot spots will inline good instances.
     * "Reasonably generic" means that we don't end up with
     * repeated versions of bytecode or machine code that do
     * not differ in their optimized form.  Repeated versions
     * of machine would have the undesirable overheads of
     * (a) redundant compilation work and (b) extra \verb|I$| pressure.
     * To control repeated versions, we need to be ready to
     * erase details from LFs and move them into MH data,
     * whenever those details are not relevant to significant
     * optimization.  "Significant" means optimization of
     * code that is actually hot.
     *
     * Achieving this may require dynamic splitting of MHs, by replacing
     * a generic LF with a more specialized one, on the same MH,
     * if (a) the MH is frequently executed and (b) the MH cannot
     * be inlined into a containing caller, such as an invokedynamic.


-> forceInterpretation does not solve the problem of dynamic class loading -> the JVM will attempt to define the MH class or LFI

In NI, everything that attemps to load a MH at runtime returns null -> instead all MH are register "registerReachabilityHandler" before analysis
-> and implemented through reflection (register the class and methods)



- BMH is a small struct containing one or more saved argument values, plus a target method handle which will eventually receive those arguments
- for opti we allow the binding of arg to BMH -> so ClassSpecializer must be able to define the LL, LLL etc.

- A CallSite is a holder for a variable MethodHandle, which is called its target. An invokedynamic instruction linked to a CallSite delegates all calls to the site's current target. A CallSite may be associated with several invokedynamic instructions, or it may be "free floating", associated with none. In any case, it may be invoked through an associated method handle called its dynamic invoker.
